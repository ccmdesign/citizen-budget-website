            <h2>Benefits of Online Budget Consultation</h2>
            <h3 class="e-tagline">The trend towards online budget consultation has been gaining considerable momentum<br> in North America and elsewhere, with the vast majority of people now online.</h3>

                <p>Traditionally, governments have held public consultations to solicit feedback on budgets, laws and projects. While these processes are beneficial to the community, traditional consultations have significant limitations. A typical public consultation can be costly and stretch over many months. They are often poorly attended and can mainly attract vocal groups with specific interests who may not represent the average citizen's needs. This is where digital tools come into play.</p>
