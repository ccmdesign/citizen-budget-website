                <p class="b-fancy-text">For their 2012 budget, the borough of Plateau Mont-Royal in Montreal held Canada’s inaugural Citizen Budget online budget consultation for its lucky residents. Consulting with their residents online on a number of fundamental city services like waste, traffic, parks, community centres and the like, the Plateau immediately quintupled participation rates in its annual budget consultation. At the same time, Plateau residents learned about city services in a new and innovative way;</p>

            <div class="b-half">
                <p>using sliders containing actual data from the city budget, Citizen Budget put Plateau residents through the paces of balancing the budget, much as city council and staff do.</p>
                <p>The online consultation reached more residents while costing 90% less than previous traditional consultations. After the consultation, the borough mayor, Luc Ferrandez, presented the local budget to the public and explained how citizens' input directly influenced the borough's decisions. </p>

                <p>Both citizens and elected officials appreciated the outreach and educational aspects of the web application, to better understand the budget and the difficulties in making decisions to achieve a balanced budget. It is no longer a question of spending hundreds of thousands of dollars over 3 years in order for a small select group to vote on how to spend 1 or 2 million dollars.</p>
