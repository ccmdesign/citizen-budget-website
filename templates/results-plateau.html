                <p>For their 2012 budget, the borough of Plateau Mont-Royal in Montreal held an online budget consultation. The easy-to-use and interactive system allowed residents to add, remove and modify services until they balanced the budget, at which point they could submit it for consideration. After the consultation, the borough mayor, Luc Ferrandez, presented the local budget to the public and explained how citizens' input directly influenced the borough's decisions. The online consultation reached more residents while costing 90% less than previous traditional consultations.</p>

                <p>Both citizens and elected officials appreciated the outreach and educational aspects of the web application, to better understand the budget and the difficulties in making decisions to achieve a balanced budget. It is no longer a question of spending hundreds of thousands of dollars over 3 years in order for a small select group to vote on how to spend 1 or 2 million dollars.</p>
